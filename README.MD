# Trend analyser
This project aims to create an easy-to-use desktop application for analyzing and visualizing data. It helps students and professionals who may not have technical skills to work with data effectively. The software allows users to import data, find patterns, and apply machine learning techniques without needing to write complex code. Future updates will include AI tools to improve analysis quality, making it even easier for users to understand their data.
